Lab - 2: Array implement using C. Delete an item from the Array.

Lab - 3: Find the largest/maximum value and it's location in an Array.

Lab - 4: Implement Bhaskara's formula.

Lab - 5: To search an element in Array using LS.

Lab - 6: To search an element in 2D Array using LS.

Lab - 7: Implement a simple Queue.

Lab - 8: Design, develop and implement a menu driven program in C for the following Array operations (Don't use build in functions).
         
         a. Creating an Array of N integer elements.
         b. Display of Array elements with suitable heading.
         c. Inserting an element at a given valid position.
         d. Deleting an element at a given valid position.
         e. Exit.

Lab - 9: Design, develop and implement a menu driven program in C for the following Array operations (Don't use build in functions).

         a. Read a main string (str), a pattern string (pat) and a replacement string (rep).
         b. perform pattern matching operation. Find and replace all occurrences of pat in str with rep if pat exists on str. Report with suitable messages in case pat does not exist in str.

         following operations on Circular Queue of Characters (Array Implementation of
         Queue with maximum size MAX)
         
         a. Insert an Element on to Circular Queue.
         b. Delete an Element on to Circular Queue.
         c. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Circular Queue.
         d. Display the status of Circular Queue.
